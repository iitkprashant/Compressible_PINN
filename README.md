Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for Euler Equations with Artificial Viscosity

This repository contains implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the Euler equations with global and local artificial viscosity models.
It provides both 1D Riemann problems and 2D Riemann problems, along with corner flow problems (expansion and compression cases).
